# The Kingdom of Illea

The Kingdom of Illea is a single-player text-based Role-Playing Game that has been implemented using Java. It is an interactive game as it allows a single player to roam about in a virtual environment, interact with various characters, collect artifacts and move towards collecting points and staying alive. It also has phone sensors incorporated into it which enhances the interactivity in the game as well as the experience.
